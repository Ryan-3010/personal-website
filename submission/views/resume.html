Make a simpler html body code version of this resume, adding basic styling elements and 
adding comments to explain what each html element is doing so that I can learn as much as possible about 
how to do it. Keep it to elemnts that are not super complex.

I used this prompt in Claude Sonnet 4.5 to help me generate the body code for the resume that I currently
have professionally formatted. After that, I went back and adjusted elements to my liking to learn what I like
and what I do not. I also had claude comment the code for the sake of my own learning and reference as I continue
to write in html and css. I would have kept it more simpler by myself, but I wanted a professional looking resume
and I wanted to see how to implement these elements in order to do it on my other pages eventually.

THe majority of the initail output remains intact in my body section.
